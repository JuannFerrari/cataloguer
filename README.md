## Cataloguer

**Cataloguer** is an open-source project for catalogue things that we love to **watch**, **play** and **read** in our **free time**. It follows the community best practices in terms of standards, security and maintainability, integrating a variety of testing and code quality tools. It's based on Rails 6 and Ruby 2.7.

It came out of the template [rails_hotwire_base](https://github.com/rootstrap/rails_hotwire_base) from [Rootstrap](https://github.com/rootstrap) ♥️
